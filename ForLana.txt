When babies learn new languages and develop their communication skills - It's much easier for them to listen and comprehend rather than verbally express themselves.
They look at us with their goggly eyes, seemingly naive, yet they are able to understand whole conversations.
I am learning new languages too, and I feel like I can't express myself as much as I can read.
This is my first shot writing a Dockerfile (I put 3 of them in MoreDockerfiles directory), I will try to make it better and study more.
Thank you for your time and effort.
